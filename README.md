# unit-4-game

This project is a game that generates a random number between 20 and 100. To win, the player has to get their total score to exactly match the target number. 

The player's score increases when they click on one of the crystal images, each with a random value between 1 and 9. 

The values attributed to each crystal are hidden to the player until they click on the image and see that their score increased by that crystal's specific value. 

If the total score reaches the target number exactly, the player wins that round. If the total score goes higher than the target number, the player loses that round. The scoreboard will record the win or loss and reset the game, generating a new target number and assign new values to each crystal.
